#### Troubleshooting Tips

If you are having trouble viewing the Credo courseware in your browser you may want to follow these simple troubleshooting steps to help diagnose the problem. If you're still having trouble once you've gone through these steps, please contact Credo support.

**Step 1:** Try another browser (such as Chrome or Firefox). Are you having the trouble on the different browser or is it browser-specific?

**Step 2:** Did you click the correct enrollment link?

**Step 3:** Try adding the course link (https://xxxxx.credocourseware.com) to your browser trusted sites list. Directions on how to add a site to your trusted sites list can be [found here](https://itkb.csulb.edu/display/help/How+to+Add+Trusted+Sites+in+IE,+Chrome,+and+Firefox).

**Step 4:** In your browser's settings, please make sure that it is not blocking first party and third party cookies. This security setting could prevent use of all or parts of the course depending on which cookies are being blocked.

**Step 5:** Are you accessing the courseware via a government or military internet connection? If this is the case, you may need to ask your IT department to whitelist a number of URLs. In this case, please contact Credo support for a list of URLs to whitelist.

### How to Complete a Self-Graded Question

Self-graded questions may seem like a strange thing to see in an online course, but the act of reflecting upon your questions and comparing them to a set rubric will help you to learn and increase your knowledge while you are still grading your answer. 

**Step 1:** To complete a self-graded assessment on the Credo platform, it is important to understand the assessment instructions. Before each assessment, there will be a page just for the assessment instructions. Pay close attention as this page will tell you what the assessments will be looking for and asking you to grade yourself on.

**Step 2:** On the question, you will see the pre-written question prompt. The prompt will tell you what you should write or what questions to answer in your response. You can write your response in the text box below the prompt. You may save your answer and come back to it at a later time, but you must click the blue "Submit your response" button for it to be recorded.

**Step 3:** Once you submit your answer, you will be presented with a grading rubric. Look at each of the point values and what each one expects to see in your response. Select the most relevant one for your response, then click the blue "Submit your assessment" button.

**Step 4:** You will know your score has been recorded when you see the green "Complete" checkmark at the top of the assessment question. You can click on the link to review your grade if you forgot what you scored. At this time, you can now continue on to the next question or lesson.

### No Courses Showing on Dashboard

If you login to your dashboard but do not see any courses, it may be due to oneo f the following reasons:

**Already Registered:** If you've already registered and are not seeing any courses in your My Courses list, go to your institution homepage link and then log in to access the course. your institution homepage will be in the following format: https://collegename.credocourseware.com/

**Not Registered:** If you have not yet registered for the course, use the course enrollment link if you have one. Complete the following steps to enroll:

*   Click on the enrollment link.
*   Select “Enroll in Course.""
*   Complete the registration form by providing your e-mail, full name, public username, and password. Tick the Terms of Service box.
*   Once you have completed the form you will see a screen that says you are not enrolled in any courses. Check your email at this point as you will receive an email from Credo containing an activation link.
*   Click the activation link. Your course will appear in your My Courses list after you click this link.

**No Registration Link:** If you do not have a enrollment link and still don't see any courses, it is possible that your course has not started yet and is hidden, or that your instructor needs to manually enroll you. In this case, you will need to get in touch with your instructor.
