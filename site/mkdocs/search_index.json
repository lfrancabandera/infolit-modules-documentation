The first step is a one-time process that sets Credo up as an LTI \"Tool Provider\". This step only needs to be done once and is a global setting. The second step needs to be done each time you want to integrate a Credo lesson, chapter, or quiz.\n\n\nPart 1: Adding Credo as an LTI Tool Provider\n\n\nNote: You will need to have administrator access to your Blackboard for this part. If you do not, you will need to ask your Blackboard Admin to complete this part.

If you're still having trouble once you've gone through these steps, please contact Credo support.\n\n\nStep 1:\n Try another browser (such as Chrome or Firefox). Are you having the trouble on the different browser or is it browser-specific?\n\n\nStep 2:\n Did you click the correct enrollment link?\n\n\nStep 3:\n Try adding the course link (https://xxxxx.credocourseware.com) to your browser trusted sites list. Directions on how to add a site to your trusted sites list can be \nfound here\n.\n\n\nStep 4:\n In your browser's settings, please make sure that it is not blocking first party and third party cookies. This security setting could prevent use of all or parts of the course depending on which cookies are being blocked.\n\n\nStep 5:\n Are you accessing the courseware via a government or military internet connection? If this is the case, you may need to ask your IT department to whitelist a number of URLs. In this case, please contact Credo support for a list of URLs to whitelist.\n\n\nHow to Complete a Self-Graded Question\n\n\nSelf-graded questions may seem like a strange thing to see in an online course, but the act of reflecting upon your questions and comparing them to a set rubric will help you to learn and increase your knowledge while you are still grading your answer.\u00a0\n\n\nStep 1:\n To complete a self-graded assessment on the Credo platform, it is important to understand the assessment instructions. Before each assessment, there will be a page just for the assessment instructions. Pay close attention as this page will tell you what the assessments will be looking for and asking you to grade yourself on.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n On the question, you will see the pre-written question prompt. The prompt will tell you what you should write or what questions to answer in your response. You can write your response in the text box below the prompt. You may save your answer and come back to it at a later time, but you must click the blue \"Submit your response\" button for it to be recorded.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n Once you submit your answer, you will be presented with a grading rubric. Look at each of the point values and what each one expects to see in your response. Select the most relevant one for your response, then click the blue \"Submit your assessment\" button.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n You will know your score has been recorded when you see the green \"Complete\" checkmark at the top of the assessment question. You can click on the link to review your grade if you forgot what you scored. At this time, you can now continue on to the next question or lesson.\n\n\n\n\nNo Courses Showing on Dashboard\n\n\nIf you login to your dashboard but do not see any courses, it may be due to oneo f the following reasons:\n\n\nAlready Registered:\n If you've already registered and are not seeing any courses in your My Courses list, go to your institution homepage\u00a0link and then log in to access the course. your institution homepage will be in the following format:\u00a0https://collegename.credocourseware.com/\n\n\nNot Registered:\n If you have not yet registered for the course, use\u00a0the course enrollment link if you have one. Complete the following steps to enroll:\n\n\n\n\nClick on the enrollment link.\n\n\nSelect \u201cEnroll in Course.\"\"\n\n\nComplete the registration form by providing your e-mail, full name, public username, and password. Tick the Terms of Service box.\n\n\nOnce you have completed the form you will see a screen that says you are not enrolled in any courses. Check your email at this point as you will receive an email from Credo containing an activation link.\n\n\nClick the activation link. Your course will appear in your My Courses list after you click this link.\n\n\n\n\nNo Registration Link:\n If you do not have a enrollment link and still don't see any courses, it is possible that your course has not started yet and is hidden, or that your instructor needs to manually enroll you. In this case, you will need to get in touch with your instructor.\n\n\nCreating an account\n\n\nManually Creating an Account\n\n\nCreating an account in the Credo courseware is a quick and simple process.\u00a0Before starting this tutorial, your instructor should have given you an enrollment link.\n\n\nStep 1:\n Click on the enrollment link, verify that it is the course you want, then\u00a0click on the \"Enroll\" button.\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n You will be prompted to create your own account. Only the fields noted with an asterisk are required.\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n You will then see a \"Thanks for registering\" message informing you that you received an activation email and will need to activate your account. You can then click on \"View Course\" to see the courseware, but be sure to check your email and click on the activation link before you start the course!\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n You will automatically receive an activation email when you register. The email looks like this and you just need to click the activation link to have your account fully set up.\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n\u00a0Once you activate your account, you will see a green confirmation message. From then on out, you can always go straight to the main Credo courseware dashboard and just log in with this account for any course on the Credo courseware platform.\n\n\n\n\nLogin With Your University Account\n\n\nIf your institution has set it up, you can login to your Credo course using your University account. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n\nStep 1:\n From the Credo courseware dashboard, click on \"Sign In.\"\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n\u00a0On the \"Sign In\" page, scroll down and click on \"Use my institution/campus credentials.\"\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n\u00a0Select your institution name from the list.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n\u00a0Locate your institution name from the dropdown menu and click \"Go\".\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n\u00a0Sign in using your University account, then click \"Log In.\"",

You may save your answer and come back to it at a later time, but you must click the blue \"Submit your response\" button for it to be recorded.   Step 3:  Once you submit your answer, you will be presented with a grading rubric. Look at each of the point values and what each one expects to see in your response. Select the most relevant one for your response, then click the blue \"Submit your assessment\" button.\u00a0   Step 4:  You will know your score has been recorded when you see the green \"Complete\" checkmark at the top of the assessment question.

The first step is a one-time process that sets Credo up as an LTI \"Tool Provider\". This step only needs to be done once and is a global setting. The second step needs to be done each time you want to integrate a Credo lesson, chapter, or quiz.\n\n\nPart 1: Adding Credo as an LTI Tool Provider\n\n\nNote: You will need to have administrator access to your Blackboard for this part. If you do not, you will need to ask your Blackboard Admin to complete this part. For LTI integration, your Blackboard instance will need to be release 9.1 or later.\n\n\nStep 1:\n Click on the Settings tab in the administrator panel. Then under \"Building blocks\" section, click on the \"building blocks\" link, then click on LTI Tool Providers.\"\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n Under \"LTI Tool Providers\" click on \"Manage Global Properties.\" Ensure that you set the settings as following:\n\n\n\n\nEnabled in courses: Yes\n\n\nEnabled in organizations: Yes\n\n\nCreation of tool provider links: Allow links to any tool provider that isn't explicitly excluded.\n\n\nAllow configured tool providers to post grades: Yes (this is important if you want the credo grades to automatically integrate with your Blackboard gradebook)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n Under the \"Default Configuration\" section, here are the recommended settings:\n\n\n\n\nSend User Data: Send user data only over SSL\n\n\nUser fields to send: Role in course, name, email address (optional)\n\n\nSend context identifiers as: Primary key (this ensures student privacy and compliance with FERPA)\n\n\nShow user acknowledgement message: No\n\n\nClick submit when you are done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n Click on the \"Register Provider domain\" button.

If you're still having trouble once you've gone through these steps, please contact Credo support.\n\n\nStep 1:\n Try another browser (such as Chrome or Firefox). Are you having the trouble on the different browser or is it browser-specific?\n\n\nStep 2:\n Did you click the correct enrollment link?\n\n\nStep 3:\n Try adding the course link (https://xxxxx.credocourseware.com) to your browser trusted sites list. Directions on how to add a site to your trusted sites list can be \nfound here\n.\n\n\nStep 4:\n In your browser's settings, please make sure that it is not blocking first party and third party cookies. This security setting could prevent use of all or parts of the course depending on which cookies are being blocked.\n\n\nStep 5:\n Are you accessing the courseware via a government or military internet connection? If this is the case, you may need to ask your IT department to whitelist a number of URLs. In this case, please contact Credo support for a list of URLs to whitelist.\n\n\nHow to Complete a Self-Graded Question\n\n\nSelf-graded questions may seem like a strange thing to see in an online course, but the act of reflecting upon your questions and comparing them to a set rubric will help you to learn and increase your knowledge while you are still grading your answer.\u00a0\n\n\nStep 1:\n To complete a self-graded assessment on the Credo platform, it is important to understand the assessment instructions. Before each assessment, there will be a page just for the assessment instructions. Pay close attention as this page will tell you what the assessments will be looking for and asking you to grade yourself on.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n On the question, you will see the pre-written question prompt.
